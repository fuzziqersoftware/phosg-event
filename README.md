# phosg-event

phosg-event is a C++ wrapper around the libevent API.

Unlike libevent-async, this is a relatively thin wrapper; it does not provide advanced functionality such as coroutine support. In contrast, phosg-event should build properly in a much wider variety of environments than libevent-async.
